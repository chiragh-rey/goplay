## Exercise details

The goal of this exercise is to get you familiar with how to solve problems on the website HackerRank website so that in the future when you complete Gophercises and want to practice your Go skills, or your problem solving, data structures, and algorithms, that you can do so in your free time.

The problem we will be looking at is named [camelcase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/camelcase/problem), and in the problem our goal is to find out how many words were used to create a camelcase string.

To do this problem on your own you simply need to try to solve each problem and submit a solution to Hacker Rank to verify that it passes *all* of the test cases - not just the sample ones you can run before submitting.

### How to Run
```
# Command to be executed from camelCase folder
go run main.go
```
